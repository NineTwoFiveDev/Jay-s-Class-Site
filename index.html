                    This is a longer section of text, and i mean like a lot longer... Like who has the time to type all of this out???
                    I do. That's who. Why am i typing all of this out you may ask? Well let me tell you! It's to show off what this may
                    look like with a lot of text, and just so i can get a feel for what this shit will look like when its all said and done.
                    this is literally just a template for what great and amazing things you will be putting here!
                    I love you! Well I thought I was going to stop there but I'm not. I'm going wayyyyy further than I want to mostly because i need to.
                    so at this point enjoy some giberish... Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Suspendisse non metus a diam blandit malesuada sed quis metus.
